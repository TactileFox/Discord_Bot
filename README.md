# Discord_Bot
My first attempt at making a discord bot 

## Commands
1. **/get_astronomy** takes an optional start and end date and returns a paginated embed of NASA's Astronomy Picture Of the Day. If no date is given, it returns the most recent APOD.
2. **/get_weather** takes a latitude and longitude and returns a paginated embed of the NWS's forecast grid for the next three days (made of six 12-hour periods).
3. **/get_message_count_by_user** returns a MatPlotLib graph showing the count of messages sent by users in that guild/server using a bar graph.
4. **/snipe** returns the most recently deleted or edited message sent in the channel it's called in.
