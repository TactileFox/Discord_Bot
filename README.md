# Discord_Bot
My first attempt at making a discord bot 

# Commands
/get_astronomy takes an optional start and end date and returns a paginated embed of NASA's Astronomy Picture Of the Day. If no date is given, it returns the most recent APOD.
/get_weather takes a latitude and longitude and returns a paginated embed of the NWS's forecast grid for the next three days (made of six 12-hour periods).
/get_message_count_by_user returns a MatPlotLib graph showing the count of messages sent by users in that guild/server using a bar graph.
/snipe returns the most recently deleted or edited message sent in the channel it's called in.
